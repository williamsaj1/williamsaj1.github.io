**Exercise 5: Lamp September 21:**  
Model this lamp using nurbs tools.

Using the cv curve tool, I drew the orthagonal shape of one edge of the lamp. I then used revolve to make it a full object. The base was squared by scaling 4 of the vertices to make a sharper angle. The shade was made by making one line and revolving it around the center of the lamp base.

**Exercise 4: Desk September 9:**  
Model this desk. Was also given the option to model it with the keboard drawer closed.

This desk started as a cube. Using symmetry over the X, or Z axis at times, I added edge loops that could be used to make more faces to extrude. Because of the symmetry, I only had to focus on making one side of the desk. Fine changes in the shapes were made by scaling edges. The legs were created separately by using the same methods of the desk. The knobs are cubes that I used the smooth tube on after shaping them as handles.

**Exercise 3: Lemon Squeezer August 31:**  
Create detailed model of a lemon squeezer.  
  
I started with a cylinder with a radius of 7 cm as I figured it to be a reasonable size for a lemon squeezer.  
I added extra segment rings to allow more places for me to edit the shape. The first change I made to the cylynder was pulling the middle up.  
I then pulled every other vertex in for the grinder utilizing an extra ring to smooth the angle of the grinder.

All that was left was to raise the outer edge and add a lip.

**Exercise 2: Solar System August 31:**  
Animate and shade all planets and moons in the solar system. Include orbits and rotations for all objects. Use shapes that allow the rotations of objects to be seen.

I started by placing every planet. In order to let each planet rotate while orbiting the sun, I placed a small object in each planet's center that rotates about the sun. That center would be the planet's parent. Any rotation the planet does at that point will only be a spin about its axis. The moons are children of their own center parent object. The moon centers rotate about the planet's center. The relationships ended up looking like this.

Using keyframe animation, I gave every planet a unique orbit that is somewhat realistic in that the further away the planet is, the longer it takes to complete a cycle.
If the .avi is supported here, it will be below.

**Exercise 1: Robot August 24:**  
Build a robot, only based on primitives, limited to scaling, translating, and rotating.  
Use each primitive at least once.  
  
Its a robot that takes pictures.
